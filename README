Main file is gen_mavg_bavg.py

It asks for a floorplan file, robot location, angle, location, and number of lidar sample points per revolution.
Using the pygame library, it mimics the lidar sensing and gets an array of sample points.
From the sample point it tries to identify all the straight lines and the angles between those lines.  
It then compares that to the floorplan walls and anges to determine its location vector.
Currently, the compare is disabled while I focus on reliably identifying the lines (walls).
